This software was designed to assist small oyster farmers in controlling their production, the storage of profit and expense values, number of oysters in cultivation and equipment, and to generate intuitive reports and graphs. This software was developed using Java and programmed entirely in eclipse.<p>
The Extension Project was supported by the Federal University of Pará (UFPA) with a grant and the work was developed at the Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Entrepreneurship and Sustainability (LIES) of the Coastal Studies Institute of the Federal University of Pará in Bragança, Pará.
